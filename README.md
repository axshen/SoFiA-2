# SoFiA 2

[![Docker image build latest](https://github.com/axshen/SoFiA-2/actions/workflows/latest-image-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/axshen/SoFiA-2/actions/workflows/latest-image-build.yml)


This is version 2 of the HI Source Finding Application (SoFiA). SoFiA 2 is a reimplementation of the original SoFiA pipeline in the C programming language. It is intended for use in HI data analysis pipelines and will be developed and maintained in parallel to SoFiA 1.x. While SoFiA 2 is still under active development, a **stable release** is already available at this point in time and can be used in production mode. In addition, users will be able to continue using **SoFiA 1.x** (https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/SoFiA) for processing their data.


## Improvements in SoFiA 2

* Being written in C and making extensive use of multi-threading, SoFiA 2 is much faster than SoFiA 1.x.
* SoFiA 2 requires significantly less memory than SoFiA 1.x (down from > 5 × cube size to ~ 2.3 × cube size).
* SoFiA 2 currently has only a single external dependency (wcslib) and should therefore compile and run on any machine with a Linux or Unix operating system and the GCC compiler and wcslib installed.


## Prerequisites

The following software is required before SoFiA 2 can be installed:

* **Linux** or **Unix** operating system (e.g. Ubuntu, Mac OS, etc.)
* **GNU C compiler** (gcc) version 4 or higher (https://gcc.gnu.org/)
* **wcslib** version 7 or higher (https://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/)

Both gcc and wcslib are freely available under the GNU General Public Licence. Note that earlier versions of gcc or wcslib might work as well, but this has not been tested. In principle, other compilers that are compatible with gcc and support the C99 standard might also work, e.g. Apple’s clang compiler or the Intel C compiler, possibly with some minor tweaking of the installation script.

You may want to first check if wcslib is either already installed or available from your operating system’s software repository (`wcslib-dev` package on Ubuntu/Debian; `wcslib-devel` on Fedora/CentOS/Red Hat; `wcslib` on MacOS/Homebrew) before attempting to install it manually.

## Installation

Once all prerequisites are installed and available, simply enter the SoFiA 2 base directory and execute the `compile.sh` script to compile SoFiA 2 using the GCC compiler:

`./compile.sh -fopenmp`

Note that the `-fopenmp` parameter is optional and will enable **multi-threading** using OpenMP. If your compiler does not support OpenMP, this parameter can simply be omitted to install a single-threaded version of SoFiA 2. Please ensure that you read and follow the **instructions** printed at the end of the compilation process to finalise the installation. If a compiler error related to WCSLIB shows up, please ensure that WCSLIB is installed in a standard location where it can be found by the GCC. Then run the compilation script again to see if the error message has disappeared.

As an alternative, we provide a `Makefile` for those who prefer to use `make` to install SoFiA 2. The `Makefile` itself contains a few examples of how to invoke it with different compilers (with or without OpenMP support). Note that if you prefer to use `make`, you may still want to create a symbolic link or alias to the `sofia` executable file in the end to make SoFiA 2 easily accessible across your system.

**NOTE:** Others may have created alternative ways of downloading and installing SoFiA 2. As we have no control over such third-party distributions, we cannot provide support for installation methods other than the ones described here. If you have installed SoFiA 2 through a third-party repository, please contact the administrator of that package in the case of installation issues.


## Documentation

An overview of all control parameters as well as a PDF copy of the SoFiA 2 User Manual can be found on the wiki at https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/SoFiA-2/wiki. The wiki also contains a small test data cube and parameter file that users can download to verify their SoFiA 2 installation.


## Additional tools

Several useful tools have been developed to help with running SoFiA 2 or process the output produced by the pipeline:

* **SoFiA-X** is a parallel wrapper around SoFiA 2 that can be used to process large data cubes in a supercomputing environment.
  Download: https://github.com/AusSRC/SoFiAX
* **OptiFind** is a wrapper around SoFiA 2 that can be used to search for HI emission in small regions of a data cube as defined by an input catalogue.
  Download: https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/OptiFind
* **SpecPlot** is a tool for producing publication-ready plots of integrated spectra from SoFiA 2.
  Download: https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/SpecPlot
* **BusyFit** is a tool for fitting the Busy Function to an integrated spectrum for the purpose of accurate parameterisation.

## Feedback

Should you decide to run SoFiA 2 on your own data cubes, we would welcome any feedback on how well SoFiA 2 works for you and whether any improvements could be made. If you have a GitHub account, you can directly create a new issue (https://github.com/SoFiA-Admin/SoFiA-2/issues/new) on GitHub for questions, feature requests or bug reports. Alternatively, please feel free to directly contact the project leader, Tobias Westmeier, via e-mail at `tobias.westmeier (at) uwa.edu.au` to provide feedback on your experience with SoFiA 2. Note that the main purpose of SoFiA 2 is to facilitate the processing of HI data from SKA precursor surveys, and we are unlikely to be able to accommodate requests for additional features beyond this primary scope.
